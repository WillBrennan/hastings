# Viewer 
## Overview 
The **Viewer** is used to "view" the images, settings, and results from your pipeline. It can be used to debug problems in your computer-vision pipeline. It connects to your pipeline with two sockets, one for streaming the serialised context, the other for getting and setting your settings. 

## Getting Started 

```bash
